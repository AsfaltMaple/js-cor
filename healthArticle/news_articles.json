        "description": "The Travelling Village is an ambitious new experiment uniting 19 digital nomad families for a four-month co-living and co-travelling journey across the world.",
        "info": "Before becoming parents, Danish entrepreneurs Nikolaj Astrup and his wife Michelle Rødgaard-Jessen spent six years as self-employed digital nomads, living and working in China, France, Spain, Nepal and Argentina, among other locations. Naturally, they envisioned a roaming life even after having children. However, their first six-month trip to France and Mexico as a family revealed the challenges of building social connections and support structures on the road with two young children."

        "title": "The untold story of the Chinese Americans who helped create Yosemite",
        "description": "From the park's mountain peaks to its winding roads to its wood-panelled buildings, Chinese American history is everywhere in Yosemite – if you know where to look.",
        "info": "Hidden beyond the iconic Half Dome monolith, about a 90-minute drive north-east from Yosemite Valley, a quiet section of Yosemite National Park emerges. Here in Tuolumne Meadows, less-gazed-upon domes and peaks are served with a refreshing dose of serenity in the subalpine terrain. Lurking in the background, just out of view, is Sing Peak, rising 10,552ft from the park's south-eastern corner. The way the topography is with certain ridge lines and perspectives, Sing Peak just gets hidden. But it's on our park map – the one that millions of people receive, said Yosemite park ranger Yenyen Chan, explaining that only 19 of the hundreds of peaks in Yosemite are listed on the map."
